#UIUIU

UIUIU.me is my experimental Internet art and design portfolio. 

Mostly Javascript and CSS based art pieces and/or interfaces, often based on other people's works such as music or books. Geometry and math too. Expect to see projects in various states of development! 

Exploring techniques or ideas

The name refers to:

1. My last name, Wu, factored (2u + u = 3u)
2. User interfaces
3. You! and I/me!

UIUIU is a perpetual work in progress. I am documenting and writing and porting and refactoring and assembling right now. Check out <a href="https://github.com/grungerabbit/uiuiu/commits/project">my commits</a> to see my progress, and my <a href="https://github.com/grungerabbit/uiuiu/issues?state=open">open issues</a> to see what's up ahead!
