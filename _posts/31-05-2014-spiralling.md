* well and i can and i die
* i can, i die

* well and i'm freezing
* i'm freezing

* well it's a sly curse
* a sly curse

* well and i'm spiralling
* i'm spiralling..

* in my broken heart game
* i've got all my files
* i've got all my ones to choose from
* i gave waiting for you
* waiting for you

* i'm ravaged like a dog in heat
* i'm gone, gone
* In Cartesian Wells I gave ?
* i am, i'm undone
* i am undone.

* where go, where now
* i can't stand
* if i can, i can die
* i'm freezing; sly curse
* i'm spiralling

* in my cruel life god poisoned
* i was born worn
* not a girl and not a jewel
* i am, i am some son
* i am some bum.

* where go, where now
* i can't stand
* if i can, i can die
* i'm freezing; sly curse
* i'm spiralling
* spiralling
* spiralling...
