<strike>Verbose, negative writing is hard to read and understand.</strike> Simple, clear writing is easy to understand. <strike>Lucid allows you to write your original text, then look at it critically.</strike> Lucid helps you polish your text. <strike>The editor forces you to cut your original text in half by limiting your character length.</strike> The limits ask you to find the true meaning. <strike>You then need trim weak words. You can also identify any negative formulations and make them positive.</strike> You use stronger, more positive words.

For example: "Did you cut this?" vs. "Did you keep this?"

I built this because my writing tends to be both negative and verbose. Your objective is to write until half of your initial character count. This forces editing and true meaning. You keep the objective in mind when you consciously frame and compare the texts.

Lucid is training wheels: I hope it helps you to write in the positive, terse frame, automatically.
