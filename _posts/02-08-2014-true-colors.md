True Colors will be a way to see how color palettes work in combination with each other.

###Why

12 Seasonal Color Analysis theory for clothes - that each person can be categorized as a seasonal type and have colors that work with them accordingly. This is an interesting concept to me, as is a minimalist closet. Building this tool will help me make sure that each color actually works with every other, and to make adjustments as needed.

###How

Angular, maybe Raphael?
