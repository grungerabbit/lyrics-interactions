	I feel uptight when I walk in the city
	I feel so cold when I'm at home
	Feels like everything's starting to hit me
	I lost my bearings ten minutes ago

	Modern guilt, I'm stranded with nothing
	Modern guilt, I'm under lock and key
	Misapprehension
	Is turning into convention
	Don't know what I've done but I feel ashamed

	Standing outside the glass on the sidewalk
	These people talk about impossible things
	And I'm falling out of the conversation
	And I'm a pawn piece in a human shield

	Modern guilt is all in our hands
	Modern guilt won't get me to bed
	Say what you will
	Smoke your last cigarette
	Don't know what I've done but I feel afraid
