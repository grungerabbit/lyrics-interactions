> 12/13/2014: eight was one of my first projects with Javascript and Raphael. I have moved eight from my personal site, as UIUIU.me became the "play" section on the original site.

-----

I participated in the [hackNY fall 2013 hackathon](http://hackny.org) two weekends ago<sup>1</sup>.

Over 24 sleepless hours, I volunteered as a design ambassador, covering everything from idea generation and UX, to visual design, to frontend code. In the down time, I made my own project. Instead of solving a problem, I decided to tell a story.

*eight* is an infographic/short story about my own dating experiences in New York. Instead of a love triangle, I somehow found myself in a love figure-eight. (Sequential, not concurrent.) However this happened&mdash;college? the internet? New York?&mdash;this is usually a  [weird occurrence](http://www.soc.duke.edu/~jmoody77/chains.pdf), see pg. ~73. And that's just a foursquare. An 8 is (at least) doubly weird.

I'd been thinking of this graph since August, when I made a sketch offhand while visiting a close friend. We found the form told the story concisely and compellingly. As a simple image on paper, it worked fine, but I wanted to examine the layers more deeply.

During hackNY, I was able to focus on building and was helped along by peers, both friends and strangers. The story and design were already formed, but I needed interaction. This required picking up some tech skills.

I originally wanted to learn D3.js, but decided on learning Raphael.js, a library that simplifies drawing canvas objects. I combined that with my knowledge of JQuery/Javascript, which I am slowly but constantly improving.

This first version looks at a couple factors: OKCupid, duration, university attended, and "state of the union," or current status. At the last minute, I decided to demo, and it was received well! (To my great relief.)

<strike>I will be expanding and refining *eight* and other experiments, so check [/projects](Play) for the latest. [Or play with *eight* now!](/projects/eight.html)</strike>
