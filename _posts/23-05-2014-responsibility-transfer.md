description: The universe is waiting for your worries.
---

The Charisma Myth is a book by Olivia Fox Cabane in which she teaches that anyone can be personable. Relaxation and comfort are key to get there. If you are anxious, it will come out in your interactions with others and affect how they perceive you. This occurs even if the worries are orthogonal to the current situation.

One tactic she promotes is the [Responsibility Transfer](http://foxcabane.com/books/exercises/) to get rid of some pressure. You imagine yourself passing your anxieties to a higher power. The symbolic weight of the worry goes away, leaving you more clear.

I created Responsibility Transfer as a visualization of Olivia Fox Cabane's technique. The background star field is generated programmatically. The breathing star follows you throughout as a reminder to breathe slowly and deeply. With the form, you can choose your preferred higher power and enter in your worry. After entry it shoots off into the universe and shrinks to an unreadable size. You are then directed back to the worry entry, in case you need to release more to the Universe/Fate/Higher Power.
