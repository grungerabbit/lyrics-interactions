- I can't locate it at the moment, but it was a woman's answer where the gist was "how do you get over hating people?" She said nobody's worth her time to hate, and if she's still bothered, she asks herself 5 whys. She finds it important to locate the insecurity that is precipitating a hateful reaction, instead of focusing on the hater him/herself.

[5 Whys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) is a system where you propose an idea, and try to answer "why" 5 times in a row. It was intially developed by Toyota to find the cause and effect reasons behind a product or design defect. 

More broadly, 5 Whys can help you question the motivations behind each proposition. It's useful for both [business](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1669738/to-get-to-the-root-of-a-hard-problem-just-ask-why-five-times) and personal concerns. For business, it can help you find problems, like its original incarnation, or clarify goals by exposing and discussing your assumptions. 

For personal questions, it can help you diffuse the emotional content of a feeling or statement to find the actual source. I was inspired to build this guide by a Quora answer<sup></sup> which suggested a good context. Challenging yourself helps you to keep situations in perspective.

I built an interface that prompts these questions, aspiring to match the simplicity of the format. I wanted to make answering these terse (yet deep and often difficult) questions intuitive.

###How

This interface is built in Angular. The UI exposes the next question as you enter your current answer, and pressing the enter key advances to the next input automatically. At the end, the interface returns all of your answers as an analysis, with each answer in sequence becoming bigger to match its importance. It is then up to you to decide what is next.
