description: A simple interface for the 5 Whys, to help you find the essence of your idea.
todo:
- Proper pages for questions
- Scrolling transition between questions?
- Progress bar/numbers link back to the original input
- Export and print options
annotations:
- I haven't read The Lean Startup yet, though it is highly recommended by many.
- I can't locate it at the moment, but it was a woman's answer where the gist was "how do you get over hating people?" She said nobody's worth her time to hate, and if she's still bothered, she asks herself 5 whys. She finds it important to locate the insecurity that is precipitating a hateful reaction, instead of focusing on the hater him/herself. (If anyone finds it, I'll gladly add the link.)

[5 Whys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) is a system where you propose an idea, and try to answer "why" 5 times in a row. It was intially developed by Toyota to find the cause and effect reasons behind a product or design defect. 

More broadly, 5 Whys can help you question the motivations behind each proposition. It's useful for both [business](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1669738/to-get-to-the-root-of-a-hard-problem-just-ask-why-five-times)<sup></sup> and personal concerns. For business, it can help you find problems, like its original incarnation, or clarify goals by exposing and discussing your assumptions. For personal questions, it can diffuse the emotional content of a feeling or statement to let you find the actual source.

###Why

I was inspired to build this guide by a Quora answer<sup></sup> which suggested a good context for personal use: finding the original pain behind a defense mechanism. Challenging yourself helps you to keep situations in perspective.

I built an interface to prompt you, aspiring to match the simplicity of the format. I wanted to make answering these terse (yet deep and often difficult) questions intuitive.

###How

This interface is built in Angular. It is only a frontend; I do not record or save any information typed in. The UI exposes the next question as you enter your current answer, and pressing the enter key advances to the next input automatically. At the end, the interface returns all of your answers as an analysis, with each answer in sequence styled in larger type to match its importance. It is then up to you to decide what is next.
