- I can't locate it at the moment, but it was a woman's answer where the gist was "how do you get over hating people?" She said nobody's worth her time to hate, and if she's still bothered, she asks herself 5 whys. She finds it important to locate the insecurity that is precipitating a hateful reaction, instead of focusing on the hater him/herself.

[5 Whys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) is a system where you propose an idea, and try to answer "why" 5 times in a row. It was intially developed by Toyota to find the cause and effect reasons behind a product or design defect.

More broadly, 5 Whys can help you question the motivations behind each proposition. It's useful for both business and personal concerns. For business, it can help you find problems, like its original incarnation, or clarify goals by exposing and discussing your assumptions. 

For personal questions, it can help you diffuse the emotional content of a feeling or statement to find the actual source. I was inspired to build this guide by a Quora answer<sup></sup> which suggested a good context. Challenging yourself helps you to keep situations in perspective.
