Reframe Me is an interactive worksheet. It aims to walk you through thinking from another person's perspective. One of the most compelling ways to make someone agree with you is by talking about how agreeing would help them instead. This is one of the main points in Dale Carnegie's *How to Win Friends and Influence People*. 

It is a human impulse to come to every situation and think only about your self-interest. It is more difficult for us to see the other person's desires. When you take this idea apart, it's obvious: I care about myself as #1, so another person cares about themselves as #1. To get results, I should align what I want with what they want. 

Reframe Me asks you to present whatever to #1 in terms of #1, instead of in terms of you, who might be #2, or #60, or #1,483,542 in their lives.
