Triangle Trail is an cellular automaton built for the [Fall 2014 tech@NYU Startup Week](http://www.nyusw.com) website. I designed the triangle motif, and decided to create an animated representation. 

I used Raphael and Javascript to plot triangles. Each round, the current triangle's coordinates grows or shrinks, then fades away. The illusion is the original triangle moves and changes shape. We get iterative triangles trails, perfect for a weeklong celebration of startups, code, and design!
