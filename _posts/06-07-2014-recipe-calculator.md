###Notes
price / servings = 
base price

how to calculate time and quality?

#####Quality
0-5, 0 being worst and 5 being best

if something is really awful
the cost is basically infinite because
you should have never consumed it and
you should have never paid for it

if something is really great
the cost is basically nothing because
you would have paid anything<sup></sup> for it and 
whatever is the reality is a steal

e.g. You have two coffees, both purchased for $5. One is the best coffee you ever had, one is the worst. The best coffee would seem like a steal, and the worst coffee would seem like they stole from you.

In the equation, we can use literally make the prices correspond to the feelings. Current guide:

* 0 stars = 10
* 1 stars = 5
* 2 stars = 2.5
* 3 stars = 1
* 4 stars = .5
* 5 stars = .25

We will examine these handicaps. It may be a diff, as with time. It probably also relates to the stated price; if in our example, we had paid $1000 for both coffees, the 5 star one might still be worth $1000 but might not.

#####Time
Needs to be compared with
the store bought time, I think.
